# WhereAmI
Andriod app that tracks my location

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this app/project is my mom actually lol. Every time when i go out with my friends and i'm not home at a certain time she will always send me text messaages/call me to make sure i'm okay. Most times i will respond back but some times when i don't check my phone or if i don't hear my phone go off i won't respond to her thus making her worry more. So i figured i could build an app which i can use to send out my current location to a server and that server will take my location and send it to front end application (website). Thus, whenever i'm out she can just check the website for my status update/figure out where am i at. 

## Requirements
- SSH tunnel between client and server
- Decent GUI for app (i know it's gonna be really simple but should still look decent)
- Websocket Communication between client and server
- Log the places i've been and the time spent at each place

## Plan
- Most of the functionality completed by September
