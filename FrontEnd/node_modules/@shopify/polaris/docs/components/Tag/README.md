# Tag

Tags represent a set of interactive, merchant-supplied keywords that help label, organize, and categorize objects. Tags can be added or removed from an object by merchants.

---

## Purpose

Put the merchant first by identifying the problem they face and the component that helps them solve it.

### Problem

Merchants need to be able to add and remove keywords from objects (e.g. products or orders) to organize and categorize them.

### Solution

Tags are visual indicators of categories that can be changed or removed. They help merchants organize objects in the Shopify interface.

---

## Best Practices

Tags should:

- Be presented close to or within the input control that allows merchants to add and remove tags

---

## Content guidelines

Tags are either automatically generated or are created by merchants. There are no specific content guidelines for creating them.

| Prop | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| children | string | Content to display in the tag |
| onRemove | function() | Callback when tag is removed |

## Examples

### Default tag

Use to represent a list of attributes on an object that can be added or removed.

```jsx
<Tag>Wholesale</Tag>
```
