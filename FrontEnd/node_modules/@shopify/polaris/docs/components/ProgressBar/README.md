# Progress bar

The progress bar component is used to visually represent the completion of a task or operation. It shows how much of the task has been completed and how much is still left.

---

## Purpose

Put the merchant first by identifying the problem they face and the component that helps them solve it.

### Problem

When a task or operation is in progress, merchants donâ€™t know how much is left to complete, which can cause a sense of unease.

### Solution

Progress bars create a better merchant experience by communicating how much of task has completed and how much is left.

---

## Best practices

Progress bar components should:

* Give merchants an indication of how much of the task has completed and how much is left.
* Not be used for entire page loads. In this case, use the [Skeleton page](/components/feedback-indicators/skeleton-page) component.

<ProgressBar progress={40} size="small" />
